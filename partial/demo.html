           <div class="child">Jeremy Thorpe (29 April 1929 – 4 December 2014) was a British politician who served as Member of Parliament for North
        Devon from 1959 to 1979, and as leader of the Liberal Party between 1967 and 1976. After graduating from Oxford
        University, he became one of the Liberals' brightest stars in the 1950s. As party leader, Thorpe capitalised on the
        growing unpopularity of the Conservative and Labour parties to lead the Liberals through a period of electoral success.
        This culminated in the general election of February 1974, when the party won 6 million votes. In May 1979 he was tried
        at the Old Bailey on charges of conspiracy and incitement to murder, arising from an earlier relationship with Norman
        Scott, a former model.</div>
